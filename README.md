### PREVENT

Prevent is part of a wider government initiative called 'contest'
to reduce the risk of terrorism in the UK. It is the safeguarding arm of the national counter
terrorism strategy; the main aim of which is to stop people being drawn into or supporting extremism or terrorism. The purpose of my prevent website is to give the user an introduction to the program that highlights 3 main components:
1. An **introduction** What is extremism?
2. How to **Recognise** the signs of radicalisation and who is vulnerable.
3. How to **Report** an issue and what will happen after
Followed by a **Report Now** call to action button that should make clear to a user who feels that they or someone else is in immediate danger there is something they can do right now.

Here is my deployed site on [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://geoff-fletcher.github.io/Prevent-Project/](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://geoff-fletcher.github.io/Prevent-Project/)

## UX

This website was designed to be as clear and concise as possible and have a simple flow to help a user navigate with ease even if they were accessing it in a stressful situation. The colors chosen are bold and contrasting to make it easy to read but also suggest the idea of action since the prevent initiative is all about everyone doing their part and taking action when necessary. The images are there to bring a slightly more relaxing tone and remind users that Prevent is primarily about communities coming together to protect their own members and others around them.

## Color Scheme

The contrast color scheme is designed to make it easy for users to navigate and draw the eye round the page. The color scheme makes the actions on the website really draw the eye and easy to identify which I think helps suggest the idea that Prevent is an active duty and that the user should feel confident to do what they think is necessary.

I used Coolors [https://coolors.co/1f1f1f-a7a7a7-f05f40-df4929-ebebeb](https://coolors.co/1f1f1f-a7a7a7-f05f40-df4929-ebebeb) to generate the color palette for this website.

## Typography

I used Google Fonts to provide Roboto as the primary font for this site. I think this is a great choice since it is bold, easy to read and appropriately business like for what is a serious topic. I used Fontawesome for my icion which are mostly just for social media links for this site.

## Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/). to mock up all the wireframes for this project which went for a mobile 1st design but i also built in versatility to give myself an idea what i wanted for both larger tablets and desktops.

## Features/User Stories

There are 4 featured pages for this website with a dropdown menu provided to easily navigate from any page to any other. In the spririt of mobile 1st design this has been masked by a "burger" icon for mobile and other smaller screens that provides a nested drop down when hovered over this should improve accesibility by avoiding having to click very small navbar links on touch screens.
There are 2 clear buttons; the submit for the Prevent newsletter and the primary call to action to allow the user to make a report when needed as part of the prevent initiative.

---

# Subscribe
This is a button link to a form to recieve a report newsletter about the progress and evolution of the prevent initiative in the users area.

# Footer
Icons with links to social media. These link take you to their respective websites when clicked and open the link in a different tab, so you do not lose your place in our site, also they change color when hovered to help user awareness they are buttons and have an action attached to them.

# Intro
This carries on the story from the home landing page giving a little more information on the topic

# Recognise
This gives the user the information they need to spot when they need to take action and can help their community stay safe

# Report
This explains to the user what taking action will mean, whilst the button here gives them the direct and simple means to do so. This links direct to the goverments prevent website. Also non-emergency numbers are given to the user incase they prefer to have someone to get advice from rather than using the online form to take action.
