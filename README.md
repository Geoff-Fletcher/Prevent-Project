### PREVENT

Prevent is part of a wider government initiative called 'contest'
to reduce the risk of terrorism in the UK. It is the safeguarding arm of the national counter
terrorism strategy; the main aim of which is to stop people being drawn into or supporting extremism or terrorism. The purpose of my prevent website is to give the user an introduction to the program that hightlights 3 main components:
1. An **introduction** What is extremism?
2. How to **Recognise** the signs of radicalisation and who is vulnerable.
3. How to **Report** an issue and what will happen after
Followed by a **Report Now** call to action button that should make clear to a user who feels that they or someone else is in immediate danger there is something they can do right now.
